# Kit lane report (004-kit-control-room)

Acceptance: `kit/scripts/acceptance_v0.sh` (= `npm ci && npm test && npm run build` + headless jsdom render of carmen/ana/marco through the fake Core). Offline demo: `cd kit && npm run dev` then `/?fake=carmen|ana|marco|lucia|control` (`&start=<s>|off`, `&tail=denied|timeout|confirmed`, `&speed=<x>`, `&demo=refill`); `window.__fake.play("start")`; sent frames on `window.__frames`.

## Tasks
- T001 · done · `npm run build` → dist/index.html, join.html, control.html · scan.html deleted (D22)
- T002 · done · `npx vitest run tests/patch.rev.test.ts` · fixture proposal ops on elder; bad op throws, view unchanged
- T003 · done · `npx vitest run tests/renderer.unknown.test.tsx` · unknown + invalid-props counters, children only Screen/Stack, `data-id`/`data-type` wrapper
- T004 · done · `npx vitest run tests/props.schema.test.ts` · hand-written strict zod mirror of all 27 `props_*` (no generator, LD-2); both fixtures parse; danger w/o confirm fails; type list == contract enum
- T005 · done · `npx vitest run tests/elder.floor.smoke.test.tsx` · exact plan.md tokens; Google Fonts link + system fallbacks (not self-hosted)
- T006 · done · roles test · Screen (+ReadAloud on every screen), Stack, Header, Text, BigButton (icons, tones, ConfirmSheet), ContactCard (tel:), StatusGrid
- T007 · done · roles test · Alert (severity, countdown, escalation), DoseTracker (meds hidden on elder), HelperAnswer, Timeline (provenance + superseded), CareRota, LifeAreas, PillOrganizer
- T008 · done · `npx vitest run tests/ws.reconnect.test.ts` · hello/snapshot/patch rev gate/event merge/prompt/result/ping-pong dead-man/backoff 0.5→8 s/stop on contract_mismatch|bad_token
- T009 · done · `npx vitest run tests/scam.replay.test.tsx` · fake Core (`src/dev/fakeWs.ts`), BroadcastChannel between tabs so Marco's answer drives every tab's tail · mocks: Core, all `data` not in fixtures (LD-6)
- T010 · cut · — · scan page removed per D22 (no lid stickers on the demo path)
- T011 · done · `kit/scripts/acceptance_v0.sh` · jsdom, not a real browser (manual Playwright screenshots at 390×844 looked right)
- D22 RefillCard · done · roles test · kit-extension type bound to `prescriptions:current` (not in contract); fake Core adds it to helper/coordinator; `?demo=refill` injects it on a real-Core session
- D22 TonightCard · done · roles test · kit-extension type bound to `rota:current.on_duty`; fake Core's D22 overlay puts it on the elder view
- T044 IdentityChip · done · roles test · "You're Marco · Reyes village" / "Eres Carmen · familia Reyes" / "You're family"
- T045 View-as · partial · scam.replay test · coordinator + control switcher sends `hello{view_as}` and disables buttons; works with the fake Core; **real Core needs to accept `view_as` (LD-5)**
- T042 captions (D18) · partial · — · `ctx.captions` adds the English line under Spanish on control/projector surfaces (Control Room phone mirror + gate say); live call captions (`control{caption}`) not done
- T012 VerificationPrompt · done · scam.replay test · yes/no/unsure, countdown to `deadline`, pending → thanks from `result.decision.say`
- T013 PromptOverlay · done · scam.replay test · "Village is calling you · AI assistant"; `closed:true` dismisses
- T014 IncidentCard · done · scam.replay test · 3 outcomes by `verification_status`, red flags, provenance, ack → `ack{event_id}` (falls back to action `ack_incident`)
- T015 ScamCheck · done · `npx vitest run tests/scamcheck.states.test.tsx` · idle/choosing/checking/denied/timeout/confirmed; only gate `say` text
- T016 join.html · done · `npx vitest run tests/join.test.tsx` · body per openapi `redeemInvite` {invite (?i= or #i=), first_name, phone?, consent{ai_calls, text_version:"join_v1"}}; token in localStorage; invite scrubbed from the URL
- T017 i18n · done · `npx vitest run tests/i18n.rtl.test.tsx` · `src/i18n/strings.ts` es/en (TS module instead of es.json/en.json)
- T018 read-aloud · partial · manual · speaks every `[data-say]` node of the screen via speechSynthesis; tap again stops; no per-component summaries
- T019 · partial · — · not run against the real Core `/ws` yet (Core not merged in this worktree)
- T020–T041 (Control Room V2+) · partial · — · `control.html` shell only: gate feed, decisions log, counters, View-as phone mirror with captions

## Lane decisions
- LD-1 The D22 view changes (drop "Ya me la tomé"/`log_dose` and the elder DoseTracker, add "Llamar a Village" = `call_number` arg `village`, TonightCard, RefillCard) live in the **fake Core** (`src/dev/fixtureData.ts#d22Overlay`), not in the renderer. The renderer draws whatever Core sends. `reyes_spec.json` rev 4 still has the pre-D22 elder view, so Core/builder needs the same overlay or a rev 5 fixture.
- LD-2 Props schemas are written by hand (strict = `additionalProperties:false`, plus the danger-confirm and parallel-array rules). A test checks the type list against the contract enum. There is no generator script.
- LD-3 `RefillCard` and `TonightCard` are kit-extension catalog types (they aren't in contract 1.1.0, and `prescriptions:current` isn't in the bind grammar). The contract needs them (orchestrator) before the builder can emit them.
- LD-4 Countdowns use the contract's `deadline` (45 s after creation in the fixture), not a hard-coded 35 s. The client clock syncs to `snapshot.now` and moves forward with `event.at`.
- LD-5 `hello.view_as` is sent even though contract 1.1.0 `hello` has `additionalProperties:false`. The real Core must accept it (only for coordinator/control tokens), or the contract must add it.
- LD-6 Fake data that isn't in the fixtures: med schedule per slot, refill doses other than lisinopril, rota week, dose week, the "lisinopril 5 mg" superseded timeline row, and the initial life-area chips. Rota follows D17 (Marco on duty Friday).
- LD-7 Event `data` merges keep `null` values (they aren't deleted), so components can tell "nobody" apart from "unknown".
- LD-8 The Control Room `a.css` tokens are scoped to `.control` so they don't override the floor tokens.

## Open risks
- Real-Core integration not exercised (no core in this worktree). The client needs Core to send `role`, `member_id`, `now`, and `spec` = the view.
- Bundle size: the fixtures are bundled for offline fake mode (~70 kB gz per entry).
