READY FOR MERGE V0
T001 · done · `uv run python - <<'PY' ... TestClient(app).get('/health') ... PY` · health deps use stubs; DB/live not wired yet; `uv run pytest core -q` currently collects no tests
T002 · done · `uv run python - <<'PY' ... TestClient(app).post('/tools/log_dose') ... PY` · services seam replays contract examples/fixtures and log-only broadcast/post_message
T003 · done · `uv run pytest core -q` · clock warp broadcasts to in-process WS hub; scheduler tick not wired yet
T004 · done · `uv run python -m core.db --apply`; `uv run pytest core/tests/test_ids.py -q` · `ids.py` done; DB uses SurrealDB Cloud when `SURREAL_DB_URL` is set and keeps the in-process mirror/fallback when URL is empty; CAS-compatible return shape implemented
T005 · done · `uv run python -m core.tools.seed`; `uv run pytest core/tests/test_fixtures.py -q` · fixture seed resets app tables, loads Reyes spec/events/views/members, and generated member tokens; no hashed slot tokens because D22 cuts lid scans from V0
T006 · done · `uv run pytest core/tests/test_spine.py -q` · one WebSocket hub and DB change-feed fan-out work; SurrealDB Cloud writes are mirrored, and the local asyncio feed is the fallback/live source for demo acceptance
T007 · done · `uv run pytest core/tests/test_bindings.py -q` · V0 dose-day and rota bindings are role-aware; elder hides med names; helper receives no dose payload on D22 check-in path
T008 · done · `uv run pytest core/tests/test_spine.py -q` · `services.decide` loads state, mints alloc ids, calls merged gate or `core/gate_fallback.py`, persists/broadcasts decision rows, writes returned drafts, and records caused event ids
T009 · done · `uv run pytest core/tests/test_spine.py -q` · `/tools/{name}` dispatch handles D22 `log_dose`; `/s/{slot_token}` remains cut/optional per D22
T010 · done · `uv run pytest core/tests/test_spine.py -q` · HTTP actions and WS inbound actions share the same `services.handle_action`; decisions endpoint returns caused event ids
T011 · done · `acceptance/run.sh V0 --lane core` · acceptance covers D22 check-in tool path, prescriptions, clock warp and core tests; gate lane tests not present in this worktree yet
LD-1: D22 addendum makes `/s/{slot_token}` optional for V0; core V0 acceptance will use `POST /tools/log_dose` for check-in → event log stub until T004-T008 replace persistence.
LD-2: Decision `mode` is recorded under `refs` as `{"kind":"mode","id":"acted_alone"}` because the decision schema has no first-class `mode` field.
LD-3: `core.llm.llm()` keeps `VILLAGE_LLM=off` deterministic for tests; when enabled it uses Anthropic Sonnet (`claude-sonnet-5-5`) for sonnet-class roles if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set, otherwise Bedrock Mantle with env-provided model ids.
T012 · done · `uv run pytest core/tests/test_verifications.py -q` · verification rows persist with version 0 and answers commit through CAS; duplicate terminal answers are ignored
